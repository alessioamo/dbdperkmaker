<p class="question">How do I save a concept I have made?</p>
<p class="answer">Currently, there is no functionality to save an image directly from the site. If you would like to save it, you can take a
    screenshot of your screen and crop it out in paint or any other tool. Alternatively, on Windows, you can press <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> and then select the portion of your screen you wish to copy.</p>
<p class="question">Why does the website link have infinityfreeapp in it?</p>
<p class="answer">Currently, I am hosting this website on a free web-hosting platform and because of that, I must use their name in my domain 
    name. In the future, I plan on hosting my own website with my own domain name, however at the moment it is not a priority as this is my only
    website for now.</p>
<p class="question">Can I save my progress on a concept and come back to it later?</p>
<p class="answer">At the moment, if the page was to be reloaded in any way (refresh, close then open, etc.) anything written will disappear. I am 
    planning on adding a feature that will automatically store anything written in your local cookies of your browser so if something did happen to 
    your browser, you would not lose progress.</p>
<p class="question">Do my images get saved in some sort of database?</p>
<p class="answer">No, anything you write or any image you upload is not saved in any way.</p>
<p class="question">How do the text features work?</p>
<p class="answer">After highlighting your written text, you may click any of the buttons to apply those styles to the text.</p>
<p class="question">How often do you plan on updating the website?</p>
<p class="answer">As often as I can! I'm still adding some functionalities to the site and once those are complete, I plan to update the visuals of 
    it to make it look better. I wanted to get the base of it complete so that others can start creating concepts as soon as possible!</p>
<p class="question">Are you affiliated with Behaviour Interactive?</p>
